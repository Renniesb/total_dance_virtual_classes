## Scripts

Create the database total_dance, then create the tables, then seed those tables.

**create tables**

```

create table dance_users (
id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY GENERATED BY DEFAULT AS identity,
user_name text not null,
full_name text not null,
nickname text not null,
email text not null,
password varchar not null
)

create table videos (
id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY GENERATED BY DEFAULT AS identity,
dancetype text not null,
dancelevel text not null,
movetitle text not null,
link text not null
)
```

**seed**

Use the files inside `./seeds` dir

e.g. to seed the database named `dance_users or videos`:

```bash
psql -U $DB_USER -d $DB_NAME -f ./seeds/seed.users.sql
psql -U postgres -d dance_users -f ./seeds/seed.users.sql
psql -U postgres -d videos -f ./seeds/seed.videos.sql
```

Also create the database total_dance_test for testing and create the same tables as in total_dance.

## Endpoints

### Videos

- `GET /api/videos/:dancetype/:dancelevel`
  - get videos for a specific dance and proficiency level

### Authentication


- `POST /api/auth/login`
  - to check the users login credentials and log them into the app

- `POST /api/user/profile`
  - to get the users profile information only if they are logged into the app.
  
## Welcome

- `GET /`
  - Express Welcome to Express

## Environmental Variables

**for running the app:**

`DATABASE_URL` is being used by `./src/server.js` to initialize knex.
The expected format is:

```bash
"postgresql://$DB_USER:$DB_PASS@$DB_HOST:$DB_PORT/$DB_NAME"
```


You should only need `DATABASE_URL` to start the application.

There are default values set in `./src/config.js` but they probably won't work for you. You should set your own values for it in your `.env`.
